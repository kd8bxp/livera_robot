# Livera Robot Code Demo

This is for the new HiCat-Livera board, which is a combination of Arduino Leonardo, Linux, MPU6050, WIFI AP/AD, 720p HD camera, and Mobile Apps (Web App)
This is a slightly modified version of the demo code for the Livera Robot
 changed AIN4 from pin 7 to pin 8, added 20 to left and right for
 increased PWM needed for my bigger motors

## Libraries

Because the Arduino IDE has been getting pretty bad handling libraries, I've included the libraries used in the src directory of the sketch. These libraries may have been slightly modified to work from the sketch directory, and do not include the examples.
